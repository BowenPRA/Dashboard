 * A task screen's language: opens in the first language offered — English,
 * from every real host — and the TopBar toggle steps through the rest
 * (EN → VN → FR → EN on Year 7). A preview harness can open a screen in French
 * by passing `['fr', 'en', 'vn']`.
 *
 * `langs` comes from the host (YearDashboard passes `langsOf(track)` to every
 * task); a screen mounted by an older harness may only have `bilingual`.
 * `toggleLang` is undefined when there is nothing to switch to, which is what
 * TopBar's `onLangToggle` reads to leave the button out.
