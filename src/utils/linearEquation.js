// The model behind the Balance task: a linear equation OR INEQUALITY in one
// variable, and the legal moves you can make on it. Deliberately separate from
// the component so the maths can be tested on its own and reused by any later
// task.
//
// An inequality is not a second kind of object here — it is the same two sides
// with a different `rel` between them (see "relations" below). Every move is
// legal on both; the only difference is that scaling by a negative turns the
// relation round, and `applyMove` does that itself.
//
// A side is `a·x + b`, stored as two exact fractions. Exact, not floating point:
// dividing 15 by 4 has to stay 15/4 and print as a fraction, or a student who
// divides too early sees 3.75 and thinks they broke it.
//
// Everything here is pure — every operation returns a NEW equation, which is
// what makes undo and the step history trivial.
