// The arithmetic behind the three top-view tide models (SpinEarth, HighOrLow,
// LineThemUp). Angles are degrees measured ANTICLOCKWISE on the screen from
// "towards the right": seen from above the North Pole, that is the way the
// Earth spins and the Moon goes round.
//
// The tide here is the simplest model there is (the book's): two bulges of
// water, one towards the Moon and one on the far side, with a bulge half that
// size for the Sun. Mr Bowen's harbour has a 4 m range on an ordinary day
// (6 m deep at high tide, 2 m at low tide), 6 m when the Sun and the Moon are
// in line and 2 m when they are at right angles. Real coasts differ (plan.js).
