// The tiny gravity model behind StillCloud and SpinningCloud (widgets.jsx),
// copied unchanged from the classroom deck (content/y7-science/U03_2/sim.js).
//
// A flat cloud of identical dust grains. Every grain pulls on every other one
// (Newton's law, softened so two grains never fling each other off), and two
// grains that touch stick together: one clump, its mass the sum of theirs.
// That is all. The book's chain — more mass, stronger gravity, pulls in even
// more — is not programmed in anywhere; it happens.
//
// Two clouds:
//   still     no spin, grains spread evenly. Clumps grow, the biggest grows
//             faster and faster, and it sweeps up everything: one star.
//   spinning  the cloud turns slowly, like a wheel, and is a little denser in
//             the middle. The middle still makes a star, but the grains further
//             out keep going round it, all the same way, and stick into a few
//             planets. (The two clouds differ in more than spin — a uniform
//             spinning cloud makes planets as big as its star. The teacher
//             plan lists it as a limitation, for a student who asks.)
//
// THE SPINNING RUN STOPS AT MODEL SECOND 16 (stopAt). With only 240 grains and
// no gas, the planets do not stay put for ever: left running, one falls into
// the star at about 21 s, another at about 25 s, and the last is flung out of
// the picture. At 16 s the star is 183 grains and four planets (20, 10, 10 and
// 7 grains) are going round it anticlockwise, all inside the frame — the end
// the lesson needs. The still run ends when only one clump is left.
//
// Everything is deterministic: a seeded random generator and a fixed time step,
// so the class sees the same film every time, whatever the screen's frame rate,
// and it was tuned in Node before it reached the projector (seeds and settings
// below were chosen from a sweep). Units are SVG pixels and seconds of model time.
